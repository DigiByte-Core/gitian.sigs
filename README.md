This repository contains Gitian signatures for releases and release candiates of DigiByte Core.

## How to Make and Submit Gitian Sigs

See the [DigiByte Core Gitian documentation](https://github.com/digibyte-core/digibyte/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)
and the [DigiByte Core Release Process](https://github.com/digibyte-core/digibyte/blob/master/doc/release-process.md)
